    <h2>INDOMIE!!!</h2>
    <p>The BEST instant noodle in the world.</p>
    <p>Once you taste this instant noodle, there will be no other instant noodle that can compete with this.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Packs of Indomie Noodles</li>
        <li>2 glasses of water</li>
        <li>3 small red pepper</li>
        <li>1 small ball of Onions</li>
        <li>Preferred meat source (Eggs or Chicken are the most widely used).</li>
        <li>3 Sausages</li>
        <li>Green beans and carrot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 2 glasses of water into a clean pot and leave to simmer on medium flame.</li>
        <li>Add spices (in the Ramen packet), add mixed vegetables with chopped pepper and onions and allow to boil for 1 minute. Make sure the Pot is covered from the beginning.</li>
        <li>Now break the Noodles and pour into the boiling water with all those ingredients already in. Distribute it evenly around the pot then cover. Leave to cook for 5 minutes while occasionally stirring it so the heat goes around.</li>
        <li>Just before it is done, add the Sausages (you want them semi cooked so they can retain a little grit).</li>
        <li>Once itâ€™s cooked and the tenderness is to your liking, serve hot together with your Chicken or Eggs on the plate.</li>
    </ol>
