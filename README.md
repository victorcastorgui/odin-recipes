# odin-recipes
This project was made during my early phase of learning web development. It contains only HTML.

There are many pages that links to each other containing recipes.

The main tags that I would like to use are:
- <a>
- <ol>, <ul>
- <li>
- <p>
- <h1>, <h2>, <h3>

The reason why I made this project is because students in college are lazy to cook especially when they have loads of homework to do. The list of the recipes can make students life easier and will not skip meals resulting in underweight.
